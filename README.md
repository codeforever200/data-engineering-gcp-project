    <h1>Project Objective</h1>
    <p>This project is dedicated to the analysis of Uber ride data. We will employ various tools and technologies, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Google Storage, Compute Instances, BigQuery, Python for programming, and Looker Studio for data visualization and reporting. The Mage Data Pipeline Tool will also be used to facilitate data processing.</p>

    <h1>Technology Stack</h1>
